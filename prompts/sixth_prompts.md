Around 8 PM as the sun was setting, this photograph taken of a riverside city shows

shows about 4% of the river at the bottom of the frame. Above it, a wooden deck, a Ferris wheel, and an elevated highway stretching horizontally are visible.

Behind them, dozens of high-rise buildings stand densely packed in the distance, their lights mostly extinguished but dotted with yellow illumination here and there. Two buildings so tall their rooftops are obscured from view are visible in the photo. 

A single road visible between the forest of buildings is densely packed with streetlights appearing as tiny dots and red-glowing cars. A single bird, blurry and very small, is flying above that road.

The pink neon sign's border and its yellow framework, extending 360 degrees toward the center and edges, 

The river reflects the yellow lights of the gwanchamcha and the restaurant lights near the deck.
